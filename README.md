### Key Design Decisions
- Chose a modular folder structure for maintainability and scalability.
- Centralized error handling and logging for easier debugging and monitoring.

### Trade-offs Due to Timebox
- Focused on core expense tracking features, leaving out advanced functionalities (e.g., authentication, user management).
- Opted for simple configuration and minimal dependencies to speed up development.

### Intentional Omissions
- Did not implement authentication or authorization to keep the scope manageable.
- Skipped writing comprehensive tests and documentation for each module due to time constraints.
- Did not set up CI/CD or deployment scripts.
